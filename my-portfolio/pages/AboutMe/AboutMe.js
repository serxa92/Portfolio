        <p class = "description">Hey there! Iâ€™m a FullStack developer from Galicia, Spain, with a huge passion for video games, movies, music, sneakers, and nature. Ever since I wrote my first line of code, I knew I wanted to create things that people can see, feel, and interact with.

I love crafting smooth, dynamic, and accessible experiencesâ€”whether itâ€™s a sleek interface, an engaging user interaction, or something that simply makes people go "Wow!". Every project is an opportunity to create something that resonates with people in a unique way.

Beyond coding, I draw inspiration from nature. Whether itâ€™s a walk in the woods or just taking a moment to disconnect and recharge, thereâ€™s always something that motivates me. When Iâ€™m not working on projects, youâ€™ll probably find me exploring new games, diving into movie soundtracks, or hunting for the next must-have sneakers.

Letâ€™s create something awesome!ðŸš€${Button("/icons/instagram.png", "Instagram","https://www.instagram.com/sergioagulla/")}</p>
